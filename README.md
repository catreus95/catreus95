@catreus95 - they/them

if im on a platform, im called catreus95, except instagram, which i dont use anymore anyway

learning gml so i can finally get some of these ideas out of my head and into a format i can for my friends to look at

when i am coding, i am a genius savant, until my code stops working, after which i am the sky's wretchedest and most miserable little creature
